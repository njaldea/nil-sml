| [child_constructor_receives_parent_user_state_type](15_sm_state_construction_contexts.cpp#L177) | Child receives the actual parent user-state type (not the SM wrapper) as parent pointer |
| [triggers_only_when_all_regions_terminated](16_sm_on_regions_finalized.cpp#L210) | `on_regions_finalized` fires only after every region has terminated |
| [explicit_target_reaches_nested_state_only](16_sm_on_regions_finalized.cpp#L243) | `EvRegionsFinalized` targets the direct owner state; nested ancestors are not notified |
| [on_regions_finalized_can_emit_follow_up_event](16_sm_on_regions_finalized.cpp#L259) | `on_regions_finalized` returns `Emit`; follow-up event dispatched in next SM cycle |
| [on_regions_finalized_can_transit_targeted_state](16_sm_on_regions_finalized.cpp#L269) | `on_regions_finalized` returns `Transit`; state transitions when all regions are done |
| [on_enter_can_publish_event](17_sm_on_enter.cpp#L49) | `on_enter` returns `Emit`; emitted event dispatched after construction completes |
| [on_enter_noop_does_not_emit](17_sm_on_enter.cpp#L64) | `on_enter` returns `NOOP`; no event enqueued, state lifecycle is normal |
| [parent_enters_before_child](17_sm_on_enter.cpp#L90) | Parent `on_enter` fires before child `on_enter` (construction order guarantee) |
| [invokes_on_exit_on_state_destruction](18_sm_on_exit.cpp#L134) | `on_exit` hook is called when SM goes out of scope |
| [destroys_child_before_parent_on_exit](18_sm_on_exit.cpp#L146) | Child `on_exit` fires before parent `on_exit` during destruction |
| [destroys_regions_in_reverse_order](18_sm_on_exit.cpp#L162) | Orthogonal regions destroyed in reverse declaration order; last-declared exits first |
| [supports_emit_action_on_exit](18_sm_on_exit.cpp#L178) | `on_exit` returning `Emit` compiles and destructs cleanly without throwing |
